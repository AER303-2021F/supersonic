## Question 1.
* A) Light source and first mirror
    * Yes, it is important, so that the light is properly collimated.
    * Spacing must be 762 mm, i.e. the focal length of the mirror.
* B) First and second mirrors
    * No, since the light is already collimated (parallel rays), and so the spacing can be as big as it needs to be to fit the experiment.
* C) Second mirror and knife edge
    * Yes, it is important, so that the light is properly focused down.
    * Spacing must be 762 mm (focal length).

## Question 2.
Use the isentropic pressure relation. The stagnation conditions are equal to atmospheric conditions.
$$\frac{P_\circ}{P} = \left(1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2 \right)$$

The maximum possible pressure resulting in sonic flow at the throat would resuilt in $M=1$ at nozzle exit. Therefore, we can solve for $P$ imposing $M = 1$.

$$\frac{1 \ \text{atm}}{P} = \left(1 + \frac{(1.4) -1}{2} (1)^2 \right)$$

$$P = 0.83 \ \text{atm} = \boxed{84.4 \ \text{kPa}}$$

That is, we cannot exceed more than 83% atmospheric to get sonic flow at the tunnel throat.

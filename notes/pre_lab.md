## Question 1.

a) Due to the need for symmetry with the second mirror and knife edge, the distance between the light source and the first mirror.
b) Assuming that the difraction index field is placed in the center of the two lenses, we want the mirrors to be close enough that the light is not deflected beyond the lense. That is where \(\epsilon=\frac{1}{n}\int\frac{\partial n}{\partial y}dx<38.1mm\).
c) The distance between the second mirror and the knife edge is important as we want the knife edge to be placed at the focal point of our light. This will allow for the transmittance of only the disturbed light. The blade should be placed at the focal length of the second lens which is 762 mm.

## Question 2.

\(P_{o2}=P_1\left(\frac{\gamma+1}{2}M_1^2\right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\left(\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}M_1^2-\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}\)

\(P_{o2}=P_1\left(\frac{1.4+1}{2}1\right)^\frac{1.4}{1.4-1}\left(\frac{2*1.4}{1.4+1}1-\frac{1.4-1}{1.4+1}\right)^{-\frac{1}{1.4-1}}\)

\(P_{o2}=1.8929P_1\)

For \(P_1=1atm\), \(P_{o2}=1.8929atm\).

## Q1

a) the light source should be placed at the focal point of the first mirror to insure the light passes through parallely after the mirror. Which indicates that $d_1 = 762 mm$

b) TBH I don't think this distance matters... cuz it's just letting the light pass through

c) the knife edge should be on the focal length of the second mirror (I like the reason of transmittance of the disturbed light. I did not know that before)

## Q2

For an isentropic flow:

$$\frac{P_0}{P} = (1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} M^2)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}} $$

$$ P = \frac{P_0}{(1+\frac{0.4}{2} )^{1.4/0.4}} = \boxed{0.528 atm}$$
